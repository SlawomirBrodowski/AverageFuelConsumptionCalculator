# AverageFuelConsumptionCalculator
Desktop SWING based application which calculates average fuel consumption of a car-my first adventure with Java :)
Application calculates average fuel consumption of your car based on number of kilometers that you've drove since last refuelling and number of litres of petrol on last refuelling. I've coded UI in polish as I'm from Poland. This was my firts Java application which contains a lot of anti-design patterns as I look from time perspective :) but please be understanding :)(Now my coding is much better, but I think it's always good to remember where you came from :)) I wrote this application to pass a "Programming Languages" exam on University. Enjoy :)
